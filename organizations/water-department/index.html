<dataset>
  <h3><a href="/jkan/datasets/combined-sewer-service-area/">Combined Sewer Service Area</a></h3>
  This layer is dissolved and queried from PWD's internal sewer shed feature class named modelsheds. The polygons in this layer are catchments for sanitary, storm and/or combined sewer flows. These catchments are used in the hydraulic models. Data DevelopmentBase Modelsheds are maintained regularly...

  <h3><a href="/jkan/datasets/green-stormwater-projects/">Green Stormwater Infrastructure Projects</a></h3>
  From the metadata: "Green City, Clean Waters is Philadelphia's 25-year plan to protect and enhance our watersheds by managing stormwater with green infrastructure. This feature class represents Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) locations that are currently in the design phase or have been con...
</dataset>

<dataset>
  <h3><a href="/jkan/datasets/hydrology/">Hydrology</a></h3>
  Locations of surface water features (rivers, creeks, ponds, reservoirs) and water beneath city bridges and adjacent to city borders. Separate files are available for each waterbody (and watershed) in KML form, or as a whole in Shapefile form.
</dataset>

<dataset>
  <h3><a href="/jkan/datasets/impervious-surfaces/">Impervious Surfaces</a></h3>
  This is one of the planimetric coverages developed as part of the aerial survey project of 1996 and updated using new aerial photography collected between 25 March 2004 and 23 April 2004.
</dataset>

<dataset>
  <h3><a href="/jkan/datasets/major-watersheds-regional/">Major Watersheds (Regional)</a></h3>
  Polygon feature class representing major watersheds in Philadelphia. Data was developed originally from either USGS and the 2004 Sanborn DEM (digital elevation model) using ArcHydro watershed extraction tools. Major Watersheds are dissolved from subshed boundaries which reflect surface flow in re...
